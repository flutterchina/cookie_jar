## Breaking versions

- [4.0.0](#400)

# 4.0.0

In version 3.0, when the path of cookie is not specified, '/' will be used.
However, this is not standard.
In this case, the current URL path should be used.
Therefore, in 4.x, we updated it, but this will cause the
**PersistCookieJar in 4.x to be incompatible with the PersistCookieJar in 3.0**,
that is say, we cannot continue to read and write old cookies in 4.x.
We can upgrade to 4.x through one of following two steps:

- Delete old cookies (Note: The following code should only be executed once):
  ```dart
  // `ignoreExpires` and `oldPath` must be same with 3.x .
  PersistCookieJar(
    ignoreExpires: true, 
    storage: FileStorage(oldPath),
  ).deleteAll();
  ```
- Or use a new cookie file (ignore old cookies).
  ```dart
  PersistCookieJar( 
    // The path should be different from that in 3.xã€‚
    storage: FileStorage(newPath), 
  );
  ```
